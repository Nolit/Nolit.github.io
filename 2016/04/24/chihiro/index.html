      <p>“I’ll miss you, Chihiro. Your best friend, Rumi.”</p>
<p>Dad: Chihiro. Chihiro, we’re almost there.</p>
<p>Mom: This really is in the middle of nowhere. I’m gonna have to go to the next town to shop.</p>
<p>Dad: We’ll just have to learn to like it. Look, Chihiro. There’s your new school. Looks great, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>Mom: It doesn’t look so bad.</p>
<p>Chihiro: It’s gonna stink. I liked my old school. Mom! My flowers are dying!</p>
<p>Mom: I told you not to smother them like that. We’ll put them in water when we get to our new home.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I finally get a bouquet, and it’s a goodbye present. That’s depressing.</p>
<p>Mom: Daddy bought you a rose for your birthday. Don’t you remember?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Yeah, one. Just one rose isn’t a bouquet.</p>
<p>Mom: Hold on to your card. I’m opening the window. And quit whining. It’s fun to move to a new place. It’s an adventure.</p>
<p>Dad: Wait. Did I take the wrong turn? This can’t be right.</p>
<p>Mom: Look, there’s our house. </p>
<p>Dad: Huh?</p>
<p>Mom: It’s that blue one on the end.</p>
<p>Dad: Oh, you’re right. I must have missed the turn-off. This road should get us *there.</p>
<p>Mom: Honey, don’t take a short cut. You always get us lost.</p>
<p>Dad: Trust me. It’s gonna work.</p>
<p>Chihiro: What are those stones? They look like little houses.</p>
<p>Mom: They’re shrines. Some people think little spirits live there.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Dad, I think we ‘re lost. </p>
<p>Dad: We’re fine. I’ve got four-wheel drive.</p>
<p>Mom: Sit down, please, sweetie.</p>
<p>Mom: Slow down! You’re gonna kill us.</p>
<p>Dad: What’s that?</p>
<p>Chihiro: What’s this old building? </p>
<p>Dad: It looks like an entrance.</p>
<p>Mom: Honey, get back in the car. We’re going to be late. Chihiro. Oh, for heaven’s sake.</p>
<p>Chihiro: The wind’s pulling us in. </p>
<p>Mom: What is it?</p>
<p>Dad: Come on. Let’s go in. I wanna see what’s on the other side.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m not going. It gives me the creeps.</p>
<p>Dad: Don’t be such a caredy-cat, Chihiro. Let’s just take a look.</p>
<p>Mom: The movers will get to our house before we do.</p>
<p>Dad: It’s all right. They’ve got the keys. They can start without us.</p>
<p>Mom: All right. Just a quick look. </p>
<p>Chihiro: Forget it. I’m not going. Come on, you guys. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p>Dad: Come on, honey. It’ll be fun. </p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m not going!</p>
<p>Mom: Chihiro, just wait in the car then.</p>
<p>Chihiro: But, Mom! Wait for me!</p>
<p>Dad: Everybody, watch your step.</p>
<p>Mom: Chihiro, don’t cling like that. You’ll make me trip.</p>
<p>Chihiro: What is this place? </p>
<p>Mom: Oh, do you hear that?</p>
<p>Chihiro : It sounds like a train. </p>
<p>Mom: We must be near a train station.</p>
<p>Dad: Come on. Let’s go check it out.</p>
<p>Dad: This building’s not old. It’s fake. These stones are just made of plaster.</p>
<p>Mom: What are those weird buildings? </p>
<p>Dad: I knew it. It’s an abandoned theme park. See? They built them everywhere in the early ’90s. Then the economy went bad, and they all went bankrupt. This must be one’a them.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Where are you going? You said just a quick look. Now let’s go back. Hey!</p>
<p>Chihiro: Did you hear that building? It was moaning.</p>
<p>Mom: It’s just the wind. Oh, what a beautiful place. We should have brought our lunch. Then we could have had a picnic.</p>
<p>Dad: Look. They were planning to put a river here.</p>
<p>Dad: Hey, you smell that? Something smells delicious. </p>
<p>Mom: Yeah, and I’m starving.</p>
<p>Dad: Maybe this theme park’s still in business. Let’s go.</p>
<p>Mom: Chihiro, hurry it up.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Dad: Over there.</p>
<p>Dad: This way.</p>
<p>Mom: How strange. They’re all restaurants.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Where is everybody?</p>
<p>Dad: Ah, there it is. Hey, I found it! </p>
<p>Dad: Hey, you gotta see this. In here. </p>
<p>Mom: Ah, look at this.</p>
<p>Dad: Hello in there! Does anybody work here?</p>
<p>Mom: Come in, Chihiro. It looks delicious.</p>
<p>Dad: Anybody?</p>
<p>Mom: Don’t worry, honey. We can pay the bill when they get back.</p>
<p>Dad: Good plan. Hey, that looks great.</p>
<p>Mom: I wonder what this is called.</p>
<p>Mom: Oh, it’s delicious. Chihiro, you have to taste this.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I don’t want any. We’re gonna get in trouble. Let’s just get out of here.</p>
<p>Dad: Don’t worry. You’ve got Daddy here. He’s got credit cards and cash.</p>
<p>Mom: Chihiro, you have to try this. It’s so tender.</p>
<p>Dad: Mustard?</p>
<p>Mom: Thank you.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Come on, you guys. You can’t.</p>
<p>Chihiro: That’s weird.</p>
<p>Chihiro: It’s a bathhouse.</p>
<p>Chihiro: There’s the train.</p>
<p>Haku: You shouldn’t be here. Get out of here now!</p>
<p>Chihiro: What? </p>
<p>Haku: It’s almost night. Leave, before it gets dark. They’re lighting the lamps. Get out of here. You’ve gotta get across the river. Go! I’ll distract ’em.</p>
<p>Chihiro: What’s up with him?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Mom! Dad! Come on! Quit eating! Let’s get out of here!</p>
<p>Chihiro: Mom! Dad! Where are you?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Mommy!</p>
<p>Chihiro: Water?</p>
<p>Chihiro: What? I’m dreaming! I’m dreaming! Come on. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up. </p>
<p>Chihiro: It’s just a dream. Just a dream. Go away. Away. Disappear.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m see-through! It’s just a bad dream.</p>
<p>Haku: Don’t be afraid. I just wanna help you.</p>
<p>Chihiro: No! No! No!</p>
<p>Haku: Open your mouth and eat this. You have to eat some food from this world, or else you’ll disappear. </p>
<p>Chihiro: No!</p>
<p>Haku: Don’t worry. It won’t turn you into a pig. Chew it and swallow.</p>
<p>Haku: There you go. You’re all better. See for yourself..</p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m okay.</p>
<p>Haku: You see? Now, come with me. </p>
<p>Chihiro: Where are my mom and dad? They didn’t really turn into pigs, did they?</p>
<p>Haku: You can’t see them now, but you will.</p>
<p>Haku: Don’t move. That bird’s looking for you. You ‘ve gotta get out of here.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Ah! My legs! I can’t stand up. Help! What do I do?</p>
<p>Haku: Calm down. Take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Haku: In the name of the wind and water within thee, unbind her. Get up.</p>
<p>Haku: You have to hold your breath while we cross the bridge. Even the tiniest breath will break the spell, and then everyone will see you.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m scared.</p>
<p>Haku: Now, just stay calm.</p>
<p>Guy: Welcome. Welcome. Always nice to see you. Welcome back. Welcome. Welcome.</p>
<p>Haku: I’m back from my mission. </p>
<p>Guy: Ah, welcome. Welcome back, Master Haku.</p>
<p>Haku: Take a deep breath. Hold it.</p>
<p>Ladies: Welcome. Welcome. Welcome back. Good to see you.</p>
<p>Haku: Hang on. Almost there.</p>
<p>Frog: Master Haku! Where ‘ve you been?</p>
<p>Frog: Wha… A human?</p>
<p>Haku; Let’s go!</p>
<p>Guys: Master Haku! Master Haku!</p>
<p>Guy: Here. Hurry. Boy, boy, boy, it stinks up the place.</p>
<p>Haku: They know you’re here.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m sorry. I took a breath.</p>
<p>Haku: No, Chihiro, you did very well. Listen carefully to what I tell you to do. You can’t stay here. They’ll find you, and you’ll never get to rescue your parents. I’ll create a diversion while you escape.</p>
<p>Chihiro: No! Don’t leave me. I don’t wanna be alone.</p>
<p>Haku: You don’t have any choice if you want to help your parents. This is what you have to do.</p>
<p>Chihiro: They did turn into pigs. I wasn’t dreaming.</p>
<p>Haku: Don’t worry. Now, when things quiet down, go out through the back gate. Go all the way down the stairs until you reach the boiler room, where they stoke the fiires. There, you’ll fiind Kamajii, the boiler man.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Kamajii?</p>
<p>Haku: Tell him you want to work here. Even if he refuses, you must insist. If you don’t get a job, Yubaba will turn you into an animal.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Yubaba. Huh?</p>
<p>Haku: You’ll see. She’s the witch who rules the bathhouse. Kamajii will try to turn you away or trick you into leaving, but just keep asking for work. It’ll be hard work, but you’ll be able to stay here. Then, even Yubaba can’t harm you.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Lady: Master Haku? </p>
<p>Guy: Master Haku, where are you?</p>
<p>Haku: I have to go. And don’t forget, Chihiro, I’m your friend.</p>
<p>Chihiro: How did you know my name’s Chihiro?</p>
<p>Haku: I’ve known you since you were very small. Good luck. And whatever you do, don’t make a sound.</p>
<p>Guy: Master Haku.</p>
<p>Haku: Calm down. I’m coming.</p>
<p>Guy: Master. Haku, Yubaba wants to see you.</p>
<p>Haku: I know. It’s about my mission, right?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Uh, hello? Excuse me.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Uh, hello?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Uh, hello. Are you Kamajii?</p>
<p>Kamajii: Eh?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Haku told me to come here and ask you for work. Could you give me a job, please?</p>
<p>Kamajii: Four bath tokens at once. Come on. Get to work, you little runts. Yeah, I’m Kamajii, slave to the boiler that heats the baths. Move it,ya stupid soot balls.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Please, I’ve gotta get a job here.</p>
<p>Kamajii: I don’t need any help. The place is full of soot. I just cast a spell on them, and I’ve got all the workers I need.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Oh. Sorry. Wait. Just a second.</p>
<p>Kamajii: Out’a the way.</p>
<p>Chihiro: What should I do with this? Should I leave it here?</p>
<p>Kamajii: Finish what you started, human.</p>
<p>Kamajii: Hey, you runts. You wanna turn back into soot? And you, back off. You can’t just take someone else’s job. If they don’t work, the spell wears off. They turn back into soot. There’s no work for you here, got it? Try somewhere else.</p>
<p>Kamajii: You soot balls got a problem? Now, get back to work!</p>
<p>Rin: Chow time. What’s going on? Are you guys fighting again?</p>
<p>Rin: Where’s your other bowl? From yesterday? I keep telling you to leave it out, Kamajii.</p>
<p>Kamajii: Meal time! Take a break.</p>
<p>Rin: A human! You’re in trouble. You’re the one everyone’s looking for.</p>
<p>Kamajii: She’s my granddaughter.</p>
<p>Rin: Granddaughter?</p>
<p>Kamajii: She said she wants to work here, but I’ve got all the help I need. Will you take her to see Yubaba? She’s a tough little girl. I think she can handle it.</p>
<p>Rin: No way. I’m not gonna risk my life.</p>
<p>Kamajii: What if I give you this roasted newt? Hmm? Mm, it’s a good one. If you want a job, you’ll have to make a deal with Yubaba. She’s the head honcho here.</p>
<p>Rin: Give me that! Come on, little girl. You better follow me.</p>
<p>Rin: Can’t you even manage a-a “yes, ma’am” or a “thank you”?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p>Rin: What a dope. Hurry up.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p>Rin: Uh, you don’t need your shoes or your socks. Just leave ‘em.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p>Rin: Thank the boiler man, you idiot. You know he’s really sticking his neck out for you.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Ow! Thank you, Mr Boiler Man.</p>
<p>Kamajii: Good luck.</p>
<p>Rin: We have to go all the way to the top floor. That’s where Yubaba lives.</p>
<p>Rin: Get over here. You wanna lose your nose?</p>
<p>Guy: More appetizers.</p>
<p>Guy: I’ve run out of those.</p>
<p>Guy: They’re not spicy enough.</p>
<p>Rin; We’re halfway there. Just stay close. </p>
<p>Chihiro: Okay.</p>
<p>Rin: Here we go.</p>
<p>Rin: The radish spirit. Sorry, sir. This elevator doesn’t go any higher. You’ll have to take another one. Thank you.</p>
<p>Chihiro: He’s following us.</p>
<p>Rin: Just don’t look at ‘im.</p>
<p>Guy: Step out to the right, please, gentlemen. Your rooms are right this way. Rin?</p>
<p>Rin: What?</p>
<p>Guy: What’s that smell? It’s human. You smell just like a human.</p>
<p>Rin: Oh, really?</p>
<p>Guy: Where’s it coming from, Rin? Come on. You’re hiding something, aren’t you? Show it to me.</p>
<p>Rin; Is this what you smell?</p>
<p>Guy: Roasted newt.</p>
<p>Rin: No way, frog. I’m saving every last bite for myself.</p>
<p>Guy: Please, just a little bit? Just give me a leg.</p>
<p>Rin: If you want to go up, pull the lever on your right.</p>
<p>Aren’t you even going to knock? You’re the most pathetic little girl I’ve ever seen. Well, come in. I said come in!</p>
<p>Yubaba: Quiet down. You’re making a racket.</p>
<p>Chihiro: Excuse me? I was wondering if you could give me a job.</p>
<p>Yubaba: I don’t wanna hear such a stupid request. You’re just a stinking, useless weakling. And this is certainly no place for humans. It’s a bathhouse for the spirits. It’s where they come to replenish themselves. And you humans always make a mess of things, like your parents, who gobbled up the food of the spirits like pigs. They got what they deserved. And you should be punished too. You could be a piglet. Or maybe you’d prefer a lump of coal. I can see you shaking. Actually, I’m impressed you made it this far. But I’m sure you didn’t do it on your own. Let’s thank whoever helped you. Just who was it, dear? Why don’t you tell me?</p>
<p>Chihiro: Please! Can’t you give me a job?</p>
<p>Yubaba: Don’t start that again!</p>
<p>Chihiro: Please! I just wanna work!</p>
<p>Yubaba: Don’t say that!</p>
<p>Yubaba: Why in the world do you think I should give you a job? Anyone can see you’re a lazy, spoiled crybaby and you have no manners. This is a high-class place I’m running here. So there’s no job for you. Now get out. I’ve got all the lazy bums I need. Or maybe I’ll give you the most difficult job I’ve got, and work you until you breathe your very last breath.</p>
<p>Yubaba: Oh, dear! You woke up the baby. Mommy’s here. Be a good boy now. Why are you still here? I told you to leave.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I want you to give me a job, please!</p>
<p>Yubaba: Quiet down. You’re scaring the baby. Ooh! Hi, sweetie. Don’t be angry. That’s a good boy.</p>
<p>Chihiro: I’m not leaving until you give me a job!</p>
<p>Yubaba: Okay. Okay. Just be quiet. Here comes Mommy. I’m coming to get you.</p>
